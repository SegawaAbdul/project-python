## Project Overview

This repository contains various Python scripts and projects I've developed over time. The projects cover a range of topics, from calculators and password generators to games and database interactions. This Flask-based project serves as a central hub for accessing and exploring these projects.

## Featured Projects

### Calculator
A simple command-line calculator implemented using Python.

### Password Generator
Generates strong, unique passwords based on user-defined criteria.

### Rock Paper Game
A game of rock-paper-scissors against the computer.

### Login Database
A simple login system with SQLite database integration.

### Todo List
A basic todo list application with persistence using JSON files.
